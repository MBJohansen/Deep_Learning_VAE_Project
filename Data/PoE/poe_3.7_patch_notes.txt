Forum - Patch Notes - Path of Exile: Legion Patch Notes - Path of Exile
Challenge leagues are a great opportunity for a fresh start in a new economy. All of your old characters and items are still present in the Standard and Hardcore leagues, but you're encouraged to join the new leagues, complete challenges and demonstrate your mastery of Path of Exile!
In the Legion Challenge League, you will encounter monoliths as you journey across Wraeclast. Touching one of these monoliths will reveal ancient armies frozen in the midst of battle.
Shatter the magical bonds that keep these warriors locked in time, but do so quickly, because the monolith's revealing effects are brief. When the effect ends, the soldiers you released will continue their battle, and even turn their violent attention to you. Defeating these soldiers in combat will earn you great rewards and, if you're lucky, splinters you may later use to access the Domain of Timeless Conflict.
By combining your splinters into Emblems, and placing two or more Emblems in the map device, you can visit the Domain of Timeless Conflict. Here you will witness and battle the armies whose Emblems you have used, and even their powerful Generals.
Discover powerful new jewels that drastically alter your Passive Skill Tree from each of the 5 legions, as well as new Unique items, and a brand new type of item: Incubators. Incubators can be applied to any equipment, and will remain there until you've slain enough monsters to reveal what lies inside. There are many different kinds of Incubator to find!
With 3.7.0, there are Standard, Hardcore and Solo Self-Found variations of the Legion challenge league available. They have the same core mechanics and items. You can create private league versions of these leagues, with mods that make the game harder.
The new challenge leagues include a set of 40 new challenges. When you complete 12 challenges, you will receive the Monolith Crown and Monolith Crown Attachment. When you reach 24 challenges, you will receive the Monolith Aura effect. At 36 challenge completed you'll receive the Monolith Wings. These microtransactions are only obtainable in this league.
From the 19th challenge onwards and for every third challenge after that, you will receive pieces of the Legion Totem Pole decoration to display in your hideout. The Totem Pole permanently showcases how many of the Legion challenges you completed during the league.

Overhauled Melee Combat: Amongst many other improvements, skill rebalances and reworks, we've added the ability to cancel animations early, improved damage signalling, and changed early monster balance. For more details, please see the "Melee Rebalance" section.
Added a new Strength Skill Gem - Steelskin: Instantly reduce incoming damage for a short duration. Shares a cooldown with other Guard skills.
Added a new Dexterity Skill Gem - Dash: Performs a series of quick teleports towards a targeted location. If using the "Attack in Place" option, the direction is reversed.
Added a new Strength/Dexterity Skill Gem - Bladestorm: Perform a spinning attack, creating an area of effect that repeatedly deals attack damage to enemies within it based on your weapon damage and attack speed. This area of effect is stationary while in Blood Stance, and moves forward while in Sand Stance. Requires a sword or axe.
Added a new Strength/Dexterity Skill Gem - Blood and Sand: Allows you to switch between Blood Stance and Sand Stance. Deal more melee damage with less area of effect while in Blood Stance, or gain more area of effect while dealing less melee damage while in Sand Stance. Reserves a small portion of your mana.
Added a new Strength Skill Gem - Berserk: Consumes your Rage at an accelerating rate. While active, grants more damage, attack speed, movement speed, and causes you to take less damage. Requires 5 Rage to use, cannot be stopped once active, and only stops when all Rage is consumed.
Added a new Intelligence Skill Gem - Frostblink: Deal cold damage in an area around your location, leaving chilled ground around you, then teleport to a targeted location. Has a cooldown that is reduced based on the number of nearby enemies when cast.
Added a new Dexterity Skill Gem - Precision: Casts an aura that reserves a portion of your mana, and grants you and nearby allies accuracy and increased critical strike chance.
Added a new Strength/Dexterity Skill Gem - Flesh and Stone: Casts an aura that reserves a portion of your mana, causes nearby enemies to be Maimed while in Blood Stance, and causes those enemies to take increased physical damage. While in Sand Stance, this aura causes nearby enemies to be Blinded, and causes enemies not affected by the aura to deal less damage to you.
Added a new Strength Skill Gem - Pride: Casts an aura that reserves a portion of your mana, and causes nearby enemies to take more physical damage, increasing the damage they take the longer they are affected by the aura.
Added a new Strength/Dexterity Skill Gem - Perforate: Strike the ground with your weapon, causing spears to strike out from the earth. These spears strike your target location multiple times while in Blood Stance, and strike outwards in a large radius from the target location while in Sand Stance. Requires a sword or axe.
Added a new Strength Skill Gem - Chain Hook: Attacks nearby enemies with a damaging shockwave. If used at a distance, releases a chain that draws you closer to any enemy hit. Generates 1 Rage when you hit an enemy. Requires a one-handed sword, mace or axe.
Added a new Strength Support Gem - Pulverise: Supports melee attacks, causing them to deal more damage and with a greater area of effect, but with a slower attack speed.
Added a new Strength Support Gem - Rage: Supports melee attacks, causing you to gain 1 Rage when you hit an enemy with a supported skill, with a short exclusion timer on Rage gain from the support. Supported skills deal added physical damage based on your Rage, adding a significant amount of physical damage if your Rage is above a threshold.
Added a new Dexterity/Strength Support Gem - Impale: Supports attack skills, granting them a chance to Impale enemies, increases the effect of Impales caused by those attacks, and causes those attacks to deal more physical damage.
Added a new Strength Support Gem - Shockwave: Supports melee skills. Triggers a Shockwave skill on kill that deals attack damage in an area around the slain enemy. Restricts the use of supported skills to maces and staves. There was a miscommunication regarding the number of weapon-specific support gems when discussed on Baeclast earlier, and for that we apologise.
Added a new Dexterity/Strength Support Gem - Close Combat: Supports melee attacks, causing them to deal more damage to enemies based on their proximity. Also causes supported skills to grant a buff on hit, which increases attack and cast speed for the next travel skill you use. Restricts the use of supported skills to axes and swords. There was a miscommunication regarding the number of weapon-specific support gems when discussed on Baeclast earlier, and for that we apologise.
Added 12 new Unique Items, one of which was designed by a supporter.
Added 14 new Divination Cards, designed by supporters.
Added 18 new Sextant modifiers, many of which only appear on high-tier maps.
Reworked 15 existing Unique Items, which will only drop from monsters in the Legion challenge leagues.
Added 15 new keystones to the Passive Skill Tree, visible only when you have one of the new unique jewels introduced in Legion socketed.

Improved the early-game experience. Fights in the first three Acts will be tougher but more responsive, involved and dynamic. This includes fights against basic monsters!
You can now queue skills. By using one skill while another skill is in progress, that skill will be used immediately after the current skill has finished.
Added new functionality to the Map Stash Tab which displays which tiers and maps have Elder or Shaper influence, or an Atlas Objective.
Rage is now displayed along the top-left of the Mana orb, so you can see exactly how much Rage you have at any given time.
Added sounds for various error cases, such as attempting to equip an invalid item.
Smoothed the transition between resolutions while Dynamic Resolution is enabled.
Changes to the size of characters now occur smoothly, rather than snapping between the two sizes.
Improved the localisation of server messages.
Improved performance of various game elements, with a particular focus on high-intensity visual effects.
Continued to incrementally improve the sound, art, effects and environments.

We've made massive, sweeping (excuse the pun) changes to melee combat. Many of these are specific to skills, but some are broad and affect all aspects of melee combat (and combat in general):
Hit Multiple Enemies: Every attack -- even Glacial Hammer -- can now hit multiple targets by default. Previously, an attack would look at targets in melee range in front of your character and choose one. Now it chooses all of them that the attack physically passes through. Note that this is not "area of effect", "area damage" or "melee splash".
Animation Cancelling: You can now interrupt a skill with movement or a movement skill. If you use a skill (any skill, not just an attack), you can now interupt the animation before it finishes playing. If you do so before the point in the animation that damage is dealt (or a projectile is created etc...) you will not deal damage. There is a small window before this point where you will be 'locked into' the animation until the contact point, so you won't accidentally prevent yourself from dealing damage by being overzealous with your movement. You won't be able to use any other skills if you previously cancelled an animation after the point it would deal damage until that animation would have finished playing, meaning you can't use animation cancelling to artificially speed up your rate of attack. You can use a skill immediately after cancelling a previous one if it didn't have a chance to deal damage (or produce a projectile etc...).
Directional Attacks: Many monsters now deal damage in a specific area in front of them when they attack, meaning you can avoid taking damage by sidestepping or moving away. Previously, monsters would deal damage to their target, even if they had moved to the side. The area for most of these attacks is a 120 degree cone in front of them.
Attack Signalling: We've improved a lot of enemy attack signalling, slowing down the initial windup but speeding up the strike, giving you an opportunity to respond with an appropriate movement or skill use. This is particularly the case for 'old' monsters.
Targeting: We've made enormous improvements to how skills target enemies in groups which will result in a more natural, do-what-you-want-it-to experience. This is the culmination of many, many small user experience improvements.
Attack Range Signalling: Player attacks now accurately signal their damage range via skill effects and trails. Sources which increase your attack range or area of effect with an attack will be reflected in the attack's visual effect.
Fluidity: We've made a lot of changes to how animations work to allow changing targets while chaining attacks back-to-back to look and feel much less clunky. A dual-wielding character will alternate attacks in a way that feels much more natural than previously, and will make your off-hand weapon choice more important. We've also updated pathing, which should allow for much smoother movements with your character.
Accuracy: Accuracy is no longer capped to a 95% chance to hit. With enough accuracy, an enemy will never be able to evade an attack, so you will no longer have lone surviving monster frustratingly taunting you (unless you didn't get enough accuracy!).
Blocking Enemies: Enemies with shields can block attacks, but will only prevent a large portion of the incoming damage, rather than all of it. When an enemy blocks an attack, an effect will play.
Better Feedback: New effects and sounds allow you to more clearly identify who you have and have not hit with your attacks.

Return to top
Melee damage is now treated as having dealt +25% damage for the sake of calculating Stuns.
Elemental and Chaos damage is treated as having dealt -25% damage for the sake of stuns. This is additive with the Melee damage stun bonus, so a purely Elemental or Chaos or mixed non-physical Melee hit will see no change to previous Stun behaviour.
As mentioned above, your chance to hit enemies with an attack is no longer capped to 95%. With enough accuracy, you can guarantee that every attack will hit.
In light of changes to melee combat (see above), the formula which turns Accuracy Rating into Chance to Hit has been changed. In general, it will be easier to hit and be hit.
Effects that split incoming damage from specific damage types across mana and life (such as Mind of the Council) now also do this for Damage over Time effects of specific types. Previously such effects could only split damage from hits.
Unarmed attack range of player characters has increased by 2.
Projectiles are now treated as having a smaller collision size with regards to terrain than monsters. This should alleviate the frustration of casting Freezing Pulse through a doorway and watching your projectiles vanish before hitting anything.

General
"Physical" is now a skill type and will now appear on the appropriate gems as a tag.
"Strike" is now a skill type as well, and appears on items which do not have an 'area of effect' but can still hit multiple targets (essentially, all the previously single-target skills now have this tag). This is used to determine which skills some supports (such as Melee Splash Support) can now support.
"Blink" is a skill type and appears on Frostblink, Flame Dash and Dash, and indicates that all of these skills share the same cooldown.
"Guard" is also a skill type and appears on Immortal Call, Steelskin and Molten Shell, and indicates that all of these skills share the same cooldown.
All melee skills now have an Attack Speed multiplier built into the gem. This is functionally identical to the effects of the "more attack speed" or "less attack speed" stat lines that were previously on some gems.
The following skills are now considered "Travel" skills and have the "Travel" tag: Blink Arrow, Bodyswap, Flame Dash, Leap Slam, Lightning Warp, Phase Run, Shield Charge, Smoke Mine, Vaal Lightning Warp, Whirling Blades.
The following skills are now considered "Guard" skills, have a shared cooldown, and have the "Guard" tag: Immortal Call, Molten Shell, Steelskin.
All melee attacks now apply a visual to your weapon as you swing to better illustrate your attack's range.
Most, if not all, attacks and spells also now accurately signal their area of effect, including any increases or reductions.
Minion targeting is now less weird if using a movement skill while also channelling.

Specific Skills
Quite a few melee skills have had their base attack speed lowered slightly and their base damage raised. This is due to the increase in effective clear speed from the introduction of animation cancelling, whereby you can start moving to the next pack of monsters before your attack would otherwise have ended.

Return to top
We've changed the way supports which try to do different things to different skill gems at the same time work, by splitting the different effects up. This results in some extra lines on some support gems, but the functionality will remain the same, and will prevent unintuitive behaviour in the future (such as the case in 3.6.0 where Cast while Channelling prevented Arcane Surge from supporting the channelling spell due to it making both the channelling spell and the non-channelling skills it supported count as 'triggered').

Return to top
Many low-level melee weapon basetypes have had their base attack speed raised and their damage lowered to compensate.
The following staves can no longer roll spell-based mods such as added damage for spells or increased spell damage. Their base attack speeds have been slightly increased, and their damage decreased to compensate. These changes affect all existing versions of these basetypes, though they will not affect the mods those items currently have. Also some level requirements have changed I guess? Anyway, here you go: Iron Staff, Coiled Staff, Vile Staff, Military Staff, Serpentine Staff, Foul Staff, Ezomyte Staff, Maelström Staff and Judgement Staff.
The above staves will be swapped to a new "War Staff" weapon class in the near future to help differentiate them.
The following daggers can no longer roll spell-based mods such as added damage for spells or increased spell damage. Their base attack speeds have been slightly increased, and their damage decreased to compensate. This affects all existing versions of these basetypes: Skinning Knife, Sai, Poignard, Gutting Knife, Trisula, Ambusher, Flaying Knife, Prong Dagger, Stiletto.
The following daggers will be swapped to a new "Rune Dagger" weapon class in the near future, to differentiate them from the attack-only daggers above. They will continue to be able to roll both attack and caster modifiers: Glass Shank, Boot Knife, Copper Kris, Skean, Imp Dagger, Butcher Knife, Boot Blade, Golden Kris, Royal Skean, Fiend Dagger, Slaughter Knife, Ezomyte Dagger, Platinum Kris, Imperial Skean and Demon Dagger.
Orb of Horizons can now drop from monsters and other currency sources (such as Emperor's Luck).
Adjusted the droprates of certain items for which there were many... hunters...
The Dense Fossil can no longer craft increased Armour, Evasion or Energy Shield suffix modifiers and now has new mods it can craft on each slot.
The Dense Fossil modifier "15% increased Energy Shield from Body Armour" was incorrectly acting multiplicatively with other sources of increased Energy Shield. This has been fixed, and affects all existing items with this modifier. To partially (but intentionally not entirely) compensate for this change, it now grants 20-30% increased Energy Shield from Body Armour. Existing items with this modifier can be updated to the new values with a Divine Orb.
The Divine Vessel is now a 1x1 item, rather than 1x2.
Perandus scarabs can now cause Cadiro Perandus to appear. Rusted scarabs have a 33% chance for a Cadiro appearance, Polished have a 66% chance, and Gilded guarantee that he appears.
The values on Life, Mana and Energy Shield modifiers on Abyssal Jewels have been reduced, and the top tiers made rarer relative to lower tiers. The top roll for these modifiers is now 40 (from 50). Divining existing jewels will update them to these new values, so don't do that unless you're hoping to create one of those 'viral videos' that are all the rage these days.
Added damage of all types on Abyssal Jewels has also been lowered, by about 30% at the top end, scaling down to lower tiers. Top tiers of these have also become rarer. This is true for all top-tier added damage modifiers on Abyssal Jewels, including caster and summoner ones.
The top two tiers of added elemental damage for melee weapons have had their damage increased by about 10% for tier 2 and 40% for tier 1.
All added damage modifiers on two-handed weapons are now 160% of the values of their one-handed counterparts. This takes the new higher values at the top end into account -- even they are 160% of their one-hand versions.
Added new top-tier modifiers for Added Fire Damage, Added Cold Damage, and Added Lightning Damage. These are available on items with an ilevel of 82 or greater.
The highest tier added elemental damage modifiers for weapons are now rarer. It will be approximately as difficult to get 3 tier-1 elemental damage rolls as the three tier-1 physical damage rolls.
Weapon-specific increased physical damage modifiers on Jewels now apply to all damage types, not just physical. This affects all existing jewels with these modifiers. The values have not changed.
Reduced the amount of Energy Shield granted by Synthesised Implicits on Body Armours, Shields, Helmets, Gloves and Boots. This won't affect you unless you decide to use a Blessed Orb, in which case it definitely will affect you.
The hybrid increased physical damage and accuracy modifiers now grant more accuracy. Existing items with these modifiers can be updated with a Divine Orb.
The pure accuracy modifiers now grant more accuracy than previously, and there are fewer tiers. Existing items with these modifiers can be updated with a Divine Orb.
The Immortal Call enchantment which previously granted a chance to not consume endurance charges now grants increased Immortal Call duration per endurance charge consumed. This affects items that had the previous enchantment.

Over Path of Exile's life, we have slowly shifted more power to earlier in the game. For example, you now get a strong support gem on the starting beach, rather than getting your first in Merveil's Cavern. As a result, the difficulty of the early acts slowly became easier and easier. In this patch, we have made targeted efforts to bring some of the difficulty back to the first three acts.
Acts 1, 2 and 3 have seen significant improvements to monster and boss encounters. We won't ruin the fun of discovering them, so be careful out there!
You'll no longer hear a crying woman in Act 7 Crossroads tempting you towards nonexistent story glyphs.

Return to top
Magic monsters now have 50% more life at level 1, up to 75% more life at level 68 and above.

Tormented Spirits are now more likely to appear near a rare or unique monster than not.
Monsters which can block attacks and spells now say so beneath their nameplate. Such monsters do not block all damage when they block.

Improved the Belfry and Lava Lake fights. Extra monsters are now spawned during the fight which grant items and experience when slain. Both of these fights should feel significantly more rewarding for the time invested.

Fixed a bug where Physical Damage would not bypass Energy Shield if that Energy Shield was protecting Mana.
Fixed a bug where you could become trapped after defeating the Terrace map boss.
Fixed a bug where you could prevent Tukohama from spawning one of his beam totems until the end of the fight, making it unkillable.
Fixed a bug where the crafted mod "Trigger a Socketed Spell when you use a Skill" wasn't triggering if the skill you use created a trap, mine or totem.
Fixed a bug where, when viewed with the detailed mod descriptions, some mods were given a worse tier than others in the same family because the mods provided their effect in the form of a negative value (such as reduced attribute requirements).
Fixed a bug where the Frozen Trail unique jewel would cause Frostbolt projectiles to continue even after being detonated by Vortex.
Fixed a bug where maps that were dropped or generated as Magic or Rare and were on a Shaped or Elder map basetype did not take into account the new map tier when rolling mods. This also affected maps created by Zana for her missions. Any rerolling of mods did take the correct map tier into account.
Fixed a bug where, when encountering Zana in a map, she would use the quest state of the first person to talk to her in a party, rather than the Map's owner, when generating her pool of maps to pick from.
Fixed a bug where the Summon Phantasm Support would cause non-minion skills to be counted as minion skills for cases such as Null's Inclination's "Trigger Socketed Minion Skills on Kill" mod.
Fixed a bug where Craiceann's Tectonic Slam skill got gigantic.
Fixed a bug where Essence Drain, Soulrend, Bane and Contagion were all bypassing PvP scaling when triggered from a trap or mine.
Fixed a bug where the Adrenaline buff from War Banner would end early if you were playing a Juggernaut and your Endurance Charges expired.
Fixed a bug where channelled skills would not update their animation speed if the character's attack or cast speed changed while channelling.
Fixed a bug where support gems with level requirement restrictions (such as Cast when Damage Taken) would change the restriction when socketed in an item that granted additional levels to the gem.
Fixed a longstanding bug where Ethereal Knives projectiles would chain long past the projectile's lifetime.
Fixed a bug where map bosses had lost the additional chance to drop a map adjacent to the one you were currently in.
Fixed a bug where the "increased effect of non-damaging ailments on enemies" veiled modifier could appear on rings when dropped, but not when crafted. It now correctly appears on amulets rather than rings when dropped.
Fixed a Delve exploit.

We really hope you enjoy Path of Exile: Legion. Thanks for your support! Shock Nova
